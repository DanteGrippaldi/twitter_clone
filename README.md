# Twitter Clone Application

## Technology Used

* Next.js
* TypeScript
* TailwindCSS
* Redux

## Data Source
I built this project pulling data from the following API: [`https://dummyjson.com/`](https://dummyjson.com/)

## Installation
To run this application locally, please follow theses steps: 

1. Clone this repository: [`https://github.com/DanteGrippaldi/twitter_clone.git`](https://github.com/DanteGrippaldi/twitter_clone.git)
2. Install dependancies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

# NOTE

This project is strictly intended for my portfolio. This project is intended to display my ability to copy designs and reflect those designs within my code. With that being said, I am aware of some bugs within the application :), this is an ongoing project and I will be getting to them.

## Live Demo

I hosted this site using netlify -- due to the free hosting plan, please allow at least 30 seconds for all the relevent data to be loaded correctly on the page :)
Live Demo: [`Facebook-clone`](https://splendid-puppy-700377.netlify.app/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
